# AWS Acount Setup

Here is the start to our notes and code for setting up a new AWS account. This is intentionally a very rough start, so that the AWSUGLnk members can contribute.

The [Terraform](https://terraform.io) code was largely based upon an article by Emmi Khaos titled [Automated AWS account initialization with Terraform and OneLogin SAML SSO](https://medium.com/@EmiiKhaos/automated-aws-account-initialization-with-terraform-and-onelogin-saml-sso-1301ff4851ab). However, instead of using [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com) we are using Google's G-Suite. There are many other federated identity providers one could use, include ADFS.
